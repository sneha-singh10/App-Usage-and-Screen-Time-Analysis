# 📱 App Usage & Screen Time Analysis Dashboard

This project explores how people interact with mobile applications and how that affects productivity. By analyzing screen time data, it reveals the balance (or imbalance) between entertainment and productive usage, helping raise awareness about digital behavior and its impact.



## 📌 Project Motivation

Is our screen time productive or just passive consumption?

In today’s digital age, we spend hours on mobile apps — often without realizing how much of it is productive. This project was initiated to explore the **invisible cost of screen time**, using real user behavior data to highlight trends in productivity, distraction, and app habits.
